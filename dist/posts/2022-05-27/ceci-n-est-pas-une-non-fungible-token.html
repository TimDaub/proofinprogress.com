    <h1>Ceci n'est pas une non fungible token</h1>
<p>Please go ahead, screenshot that NFT - reupload it; hell, use the screenshot as
your Twitter PFP despite not having paid a single Wei for it! Yes, I don't care - It's because an NFT's image is METAdata. It's purely symbolical. Not a
certificate of authenticity; it isn't the actual artwork either. It's just a
symbol for a concept that has a price. Let me explain.</p>
<h2>Ceci n'est pas une certificate of authenticity</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/a-pipe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you've never seen René Magritte's iconic surrealist painting, I can't help
you. My website isn't capable of transferring the actual image's atoms in front
of you. So yes, let me be annoyingly pedantic and remark: The picture
displayed above, called &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot; isn't Magritte's piece.</p>
<p>Rather, it's a symbolic digital representation of his <em>real</em> work. Someone took
a photo of the original painting and so what you're seeing here is one of the
many digital copies of Magritte's work. The real, physically painted canvas is
currently on display in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>All of this to convey just that one aspect of Magritte's work: &quot;Ceci n'est pas
une pipe&quot;, meaning &quot;That's not a pipe.&quot; Because, the painting depicts <em>a
drawing</em> of a pipe and not <em>just a pipe</em> - so really what's drawn on the canvas
is a symbol.</p>
<p>While today, this being a rather obvious observation - in terms of correctly
identifying concepts, I think Magritte's work is significant. It draws us
towards a certain confusion - we start conversing, discussing and learning
what's real and what's &quot;just&quot; a symbol. What's particularly interesting for me
is the pendanty this work emits.</p>
<p>At the risk of being taken for a trolling attempt, Magritte points out the
necessity to correctly identify things for what they are. I've come across this
phenomenon so many times; and I'd wish we'd wake up to it more often. In
Kahneman's words, &quot;System 1&quot; is rushing to false conclusions, when we should
engage number 2 - think slowly.</p>
<p>So then what are NFTs?</p>
<h2>NFTs are symbols.</h2>
<p>There are two reasons, I've started connecting symbolism to NFTs. It's because
of two discussions that recently emerged in the field.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/curating-value-exchange/">Hito Steyerl's interview with Other
Internet</a> where she
recaptures the ideas behind <a href="https://strikedao.com/">strikedao.com</a>, squatting
Bundeskunsthalle and <a href="/2022/03/27/the-user-experience-problems-of-quadratic-voting/">experimenting with quadratic
voting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Hart (SH): Squatting a name as a way to occupy the
[Bundeskunsthalle] is something we want to ask about as well. Domain
squatting has been a practice for as long as there's been domain names, but
there's a particular significance to deliberately claiming their name? What
pointed you in that direction?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hito Steyerl (HS): Well, I mean, it's the whole NFT magic. It's laying claim
to something. You don't exactly know what it's supposed to be, but it's
supposed to be very strong as a claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context here is that Hito Steyerl, in an attempt to squat the German
exhibition hall Bundeskunsthalle, had symbolically bought
&quot;bundeskunsthalle.eth&quot; as a claim to use it for running governance experiments;
not to claim it as her property. Here's how she explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SH: what first motivated you to squat art institution ENS domains?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HS: It was sort of a whim, I guess. I knew I had to do a talk at the Royal
College of Art in London, which at that point was in lockdown, but they still
had a student strike at hand because the college was still trying to take
tuition. There were no studio spaces or no activities to talk of, so there
was a student strike. Basically, I was trying to roll all of it into one by
minting the whole institution as an NFT and giving it to the students in
exchange for a larp, which they were supposed to create. Transforming it into
a worker, self-managed institution. That was the idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HS: When I asked María Paula how to mint this most efficiently she said I should
just buy the domain because this would be formatted as an NFT anyway, but it
would also have the sort of squatting dimension, which I liked because
squatting is also sort of devalidation of a property title. I mean, you're
not claiming property of something, you're claiming usage of something. It's
not occupying it in the sense that you claim it for yourself. Then, I started
minting some other ones at that time. I thought I will maybe use them
someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she never intended to claim the Bundeskunsthalle as her property by
squatting &quot;bundeskunsthalle.eth&quot;: She used squatting the domain as a lever to
motivate a broader discussion about governance. Squatting symbolizing a claim
of power.</p>
<p>It is interesting, this type of action in the context of NFTs because it attempts
to describe their utility. &quot;Laying claim to something [symbolically].&quot;</p>
<p>But it doesn't conclusivly answer the question what NFTs are. Really, are they
symbols? Or maybe certificates of authenticity?</p>
<h2>Are NFTs Certificates of Authenticity?</h2>

<p>On Wednesday last week, I was invited to a panel at NFTBerlin to talk about the
history of NFTs and &quot;What we've done.&quot; I'm bringing it up here, as Beatriz
Helena Ramoz, my co-panelist, from <a href="https://dada.nyc/home">dada.nyc</a> touched
upon some widely-contested definitions of NFTs.</p>
<p>On stage, we asked ourselves what NFTs are. Certificates of authenticity?
Programmatic pointers to storage spaces in the EVM? Or do they represent the
actual artwork?</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of fostering autodidacticism, I'd now like to take the NFT
screenshotting meme ad absurdum for further seeking answers:</p>

<p>Follow these four easy steps to get rich quick, anon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your favorite stock training app, and pick your favorite stock. (e.g.
AAPL)</li>
<li>Now, look for the image representing the stock.</li>
<li>Screenshot that stock's image</li>
<li>Profit! And since you didn't have to spend a single penny to own Apple -
you, dear stranger from the interwebs, are a genius.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yes, here's my main point: NFTs aren't certificates of authenticity either.
They're conceptual symbols and we're giving them a price on markets like
OpenSea.</p>
<p>In fact, lots of interactions on the computer are just symbolic - we probably
don't even notice anymore.</p>
<p>For example, when you &quot;like&quot; someone's photo of a cake on Instagram, you're
tapping the &quot;thumbs-up&quot; button. You're not directly communicating with anyone
really.</p>
<p>Instead, the Instagram user interface tells a server that they can now
broadcast information to everybody else that you &quot;like&quot; an image. And really,
it's all just symbolic that you've instructed your computer to communicate
information.</p>
<p>Sure, we've become so comfortable with social media use that we think &quot;we're
communicating with others.&quot; But really, we're communicating with our computer,
and then that computer communicates with other computers until a computer again
communicates with a human and so on. By liking we're not &quot;saying&quot; (as in e.g.
speaking/writing) anything online.</p>
<p>And so similarly, NFTs don't really represent an artist's artwork - even though
an artist might explicitly want you to believe that.</p>
<p>In fact, if you dive all the way down the rabbit hole, you'll find that the
original NFT standard document, the EIP-721.md, defines the NFT's image within
the &quot;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification">ERC721 <strong>Metadata</strong> JSON
Schema</a>&quot;. So there you
have it. The image is merely &quot;metadata&quot;, not the actual entity (which is the
NFT itself).</p>
<h2>NFTs are data structures or financial instruments</h2>
<p>This leads us to conclude that essentially NFTs are nothing but on-chain data
structures allowing market-based price discovery. If you give them value in,
e.g., Ether or USD, they become interest-bearing financial instruments. They're
quite similar to stocks or tokens.</p>
<p>NFTs aren't the artwork (in most cases); they may also not <em>represent</em> the
artwork. And they're not certificates of authenticity.</p>
<p>Instead, NFTs symbolize what their issuer has done in the past, does today, and
could do tomorrow. They're non-fungible, interest-bearing financial instruments
that allow for both speculation (on the investor side) and conceptual
liquidation of intellectual property to dollars (on the issuer side).</p>
