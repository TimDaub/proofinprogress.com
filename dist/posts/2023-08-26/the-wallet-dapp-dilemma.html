    <h1>The Wallet-Dapp Dilemma</h1>
<p>The Wallet-Dapp dilemma is when, despite the exceptional quality of a dapp, a
wallet's bugs make dapp users churn.</p>
<p>Dapp builders spend 1000 hours perfecting their products, but many wallets
don't work well.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why wallets don't work: (1) They track user activity,
and so many break with ad blockers enabled. (2) Wallets often connect via the
internet, making interactions slow. (3) And lots of lesser-known wallets aren't
world-class or actively maintained.</p>
<p>Dapps can be built perfectly, but it only takes 1 wallet to screw everything
up.</p>
<p>The dilemma is that dapp builders aren't in control; the wallet providers are.
And they have made millions from implementing token swap features - not from
serving their users.</p>
<p>How much revenue will wallet providers gain from serving decentralized+social?
And will it be enough to level up their UX for consumer crypto?</p>
<p>Wallets have held back dapp builders; they're now in our way. And they're the
middlemen we aimed to disintermediate.</p>
<p>Warpcast has recognized this early on. &quot;If you can't fight them, join them.&quot;
And so, they've implemented a wallet themselves.</p>
<p>However, implementing a wallet is difficult, costly, and there are security
considerations. Many dapp builders won't be able to afford this independence -
they will be forced to focus on growing their daily active users instead.</p>
<p>So, what can be done to dissolve this dilemma?</p>
<p>We and our users deserve
world-class experiences. But, wallet providers' incentives seem to be opposed.
So what can we do?</p>
