    <h1>Illuminating the Dark Forest</h1>
<p><em>(Originially posted on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/r9d9gf/illuminating_the_dark_forest/">/r/ethereum</a>)</em></p>
<p>We've now been in the bull market for so long that I believe the reference
frame for what many of us initially came to crypto for is starting to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>Today, besides angry gas fee posts, what really seems to be popping is
borderline-legal DAO meme projects that promise wildly seductive APY numbers
(&quot;7000% APY&quot;), while the reality is that many of those projects are outright
illegal and immoral Ponzi schemes with great web design though.</p>
<p>Seeing all those huge green numbers on a daily basis, it's easy to sometimes
forget why we joined the space in the first place: to build better
organizations and to update the internet!</p>
<p>As a case in point, OlympusDAO:</p>
<p>By visiting its website, it's almost hard to believe: but a project like the
much-hyped OlympusDAO registered their domain just months ago, on 2021-03-27,
and so I find it kind of difficult to understand if the project and its members
have the required long-term commitment to make meaningful contributions to the
space [5]. Especially because innovating in the space has historically only
worked through grinding the bleeding edge for multiple years at a time. I don't
doubt the integrity of the OlympusDAO's founders. But that's because I simply
don't know them!</p>
<p>How do I know that meaningful contribution only comes through long-term
commitment? I've been a founding member of ascribe.io and the Ocean Protocol,
and they've been shipping for 6 years straight now to get to where they're
today: on CMC #130 [2]! The classic ten years to an overnight success story.</p>
<p>But more simply put, the point I'm trying to make here is that the provenance
mechanism we're so proud of in the NFT space has started to become broken in
the web3 startup space!</p>
<p>Even for a seasoned developer, it's become harder and harder to understand what
are good projects and who are those that are just in for the quick money or
pulling the rug [3, 9].</p>
<p>The provenance of crypto startups has become unclear as, given regulatory
pressure, many startup founders have chosen to launch anonymously. It's cool
because it means that many traditionally discriminated people can now launch a
project without facing unnecessary scrutiny or glass ceilings. It's bad because
we have no reference point anymore for who's done good in the past and who's
done bad. Today, how can we know? And as users, how can we protect ourselves
and our investments?</p>
<p>At the same time, the security incidents plaguing smart contracts have become
frequent pop-cultural events; We don't even take them seriously anymore.
They've become entertainment as rekt.news existence proves [4]. It's as if we
can't wait to hear about the latest hacked developers and the background story:
But cloaked behind these seemingly unspectacular security incidents hides a
much bigger crisis! It's that web3 has become a DARK and DANGEROUS place! In
2020, D. Robinson and G. Konstantopoulos write: &quot;Ethereum is a dark forest.&quot;
[1].</p>
<p>In the authors' own words, Ethereum's story has become &quot;a horror story.&quot; It is
about a dystopian, adversarial, and unlawful place where everyone just banks on
the weakness of their peers for their personal profit. &quot;An environment in which
detection means certain death at the hands of advanced predators&quot; [1].</p>
<p>Through those eyes that seem to see today's reality more clearly than our naive
web2 goggles, all web3 products ought to be at first observed with caution.
What are the true motivations that guide some DAO's masterminds? Are they here
to change the world for the better? Or are they merely attempting an elaborate
coup for their personal enrichment?</p>
<p>The problem in today's space is that WE CANNOT KNOW! The infrastructure for
documenting and fighting scams simply isn't there. We're not capable of
resolving disputes, but even worse: We're not even properly documenting what's
happening. My biggest fear is that if the crypto space continues to fail to
regulate itself: Inherently, we'll have to be regulated ... by you know whom!</p>
<p>The most we do t0day, is that we reside to document scams on, e.g., Reddit
through &quot;lists of rug pulls&quot; [6]. I guess we're also trying to warn our peers
in DMs, and for particularly bad cases, we sometimes speak up publicly.</p>
<p>But most attacks on all our hard-earned money aren't &quot;security&quot; incidents as it
is, e.g., framed by rekt.news.</p>
<p>Sure, these events are disguised as broken contracts and flawed
implementations: But the reality is that all those hackers causing them ended
up taking the calculated risk of stealing money from users as coin mixing
allows them to anonymously exit their profits, e.g., through tornado.cash [7].</p>
<p>So while it looks as though the situation is under control through
ever-improving static analysis tools and more frequent security audits, the
problem isn't directly about building flawless smart contracts but much more
about the integrity of project founders! The web3 community has a safety crisis
and flawed smart contract security is merely a side effect.</p>
<p>It's because the web3 space that prouds itself with its friendliness towards
anonymous project founders has created a system so immune to proper provenance
that it stops becoming humanly possible to do proper due diligence before
committing funds. Even as a long-term member of the space, it's become tough
knowing the wheat from the chaff!</p>
<p>A path out of the dark forest, or at least towards finding a guiding light that
could illuminate it, lies, in my opinion, in improving the current provenance
system through algorithmically-aided positive reinforcement and better
documentation. We need to strengthen our capacity to do due diligence
collectively.</p>
<p>To learn from our mistakes and the space's most flawed projects, I think it is
up to all of us to make a change!</p>
<p>We have to start documenting shady behavior not only when it's too late. We
should hold adversarial founders accountable not only after they've committed
immoral action - but throughout their entire rise to fame.</p>
<p>Finally, we're now in a time where data can truly be available for extended
periods of time and where we're capable of easily verifying its integrity. It's
a chance for us to build better infrastructure for documenting what is
happening, annotating documents, and exposing troublesome information.</p>
<p>Using on-chain data, we can now rate a project's health in real-time and
potentially provide relative safety scores. Dispute resolution protocols like
Kleros and others may potentially even allow us to resolve confliects within
web3 - without ever having to surface into the world of atoms [8].</p>
<p>We have the tools to illuminate the dark forest and make it a safe place for
everyone. But it's on us to work in making that change happen! To illuminate
the dark forest.</p>
