<p>Yes, and it's GitHub. GitHub is an explorer and a search engine for the git
protocol, and so most of the data I submit to it or edit is replicated locally.
I edit most of my work on my computer's command line - but GitHub is often
useful when navigating to bits of code &quot;far away&quot; from my command line's
cursor. It has a slightly nicer syntax highlighting, a fantastic internal
search, and an integration with a search engine like Google.</p>
<p>Given that git isn't opinionated about the editor I use to write texts or
manipulate my Unix-based file system, I've optimized my workflow by using a pro
tool called vim - a special text editor. But I use a flurry of other Unix tools
too, and they're all well-documented, free of charge, and non-proprietary.</p>
<p>Also, they don't track me. They're generally rather secure and aren't targeted
for cyber attacks as much as consumer apps are. Files are a beautiful and
versatile abstraction and integrate well with git, my operating system, and
GitHub.</p>
<p>Most importantly, by voluntarily opting into GitHub's features besides their
git remote hosting, I can customize my user interfaces to a very high degree.
See, having to work many hours a day with GitHub and git, I've found that even
slight flaws or mismatches in the user interface I use for working can
significantly impact my mental health. So having the freedom to customize,
style, and use the tools I prefer to manipulate the fundamental data structure
on GitHub is, in my opinion, the key to why people like me love to use it.</p>
<p>And I would like to generalize this further than GitHub and say that I also use
other websites where this metaphor for interaction is executed, where the
website is merely a collection of &quot;immutable&quot; documents and is meant to explore
and not to edit.</p>
<p>It's because editing and manipulating on the web is so painful. Website state
can be lost, there are many rendering issues, and website structures sometimes
get re-rendered under my cursor; login state is fragile, and I'm being tracked
and observed everywhere by giant global corporations stealing my data to enrich
themselves and their shareholders.</p>
<p>The best websites I use are explorers and not editors.</p>
