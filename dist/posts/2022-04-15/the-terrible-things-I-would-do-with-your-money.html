    <h1>The terrible things I'd do with your money</h1>
<p>In some of Daniel Kahnemann's books and any other business advice-type
articles, you always seem to read the same argument: The thing important people
all over the world would like to see is increased risk-taking in the workplace.</p>
<p>And having spent roughly seven years in the startup space, I'm starting to
agree immensely with this sentiment. It's the unique Gen Z-er feeling of
boredom, flicking through startup ideas like your Tiktok feed only to realize
that 99% of it - you've already seen it and that you're exhausted.</p>
<p>The craving for <em>true</em> originality, just a little hit of dopamine for
experiencing <em>the new</em>, it has become scarily real for me not only on social
media but also in the startup space.</p>
<p>So let me tell you in my real voice right now, &quot;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/r/rsv/rsv-idx?type=citation&amp;book=Acts&amp;chapno=9&amp;startverse=18&amp;endverse=20">It fell like scales from my
eyes</a>&quot;
when I read Nick Tredennick's &quot;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/an-engineers-view-of-venture-capitalists-2650252508">Engineer's View of Venture
Capitalists</a>&quot;
article; from 2001 and saw him claim that &quot;VCs are sheep. They don't take
risks.&quot;</p>
<p>Outrageous! The audacity he has to make such claims! After all, in terms of the
type of investments, aren't VCs quasi <em>the</em> risk-takers that keep our economy
going?</p>
<h2>&quot;VCs are sheep.&quot;</h2>
<p>But Nick's right. Particularly when focusing our attention on what really gets
funded and who are the new hot companies. Already the mainstream terminology
makes me wanna throw up: &quot;Unicorn!&quot; ðŸ¤®</p>
<p>Because, yes, after having hot meals delivered to your house and that
absolutely <em>not</em> going great for years: Why not try now also to deliver cold
food (aka. groceries) too but under a different brand name and a slightly
adjusted business process.</p>
<p>And since this article is about keeping you engaged through quantitative
originality, just tangentially, maybe conspiracies are popular these days
because they're less boring than reality!</p>
<p>But yes, this is what it has come to: In Europe, the hot &quot;tech&quot; Unicorns are:
&quot;Gorillaz,&quot; &quot;Flink,&quot; and &quot;Getir&quot; - all grocery delivery startups with exactly
the same market positioning and value proposition. They deliver food on bikes.</p>
<p>But not only does this situation confirm that VCs are indeed sheep, that they
all <em>baa</em> the minute one <em>baas</em> - it also shows the level of risk aversion they
exhibit.</p>
<p>Sure, here and there may be investors that fund radically new ideas, but isn't
it interesting that the evolutionary output VCs are curating usually just
bubbles up boring stuff?</p>
<h2>VCs don't take (enough) risks. And neither do startup founders.</h2>
<p>It's funny because it's true. In a way, the annoying South African dude on
Twitter and the notorious lying woman posing as female Steve Jobs did/do one
thing well: They've both gone all-in; mega bold and despite the odds stacked
against them.</p>
<p>As an engineer that has been <a href="/2021/10/21/on-chain-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/">kept in check by founders and
managers</a> for years - since
they always want you to factor in the business side while developing tech, I
admire the boldness of <em>true</em> risk-takers â€” the insanity of wanting to settle
on Mars or to blood-test everyone with a tiny pinch.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I get told by my collaborators to deleverage risk; when they
want me to ship something visible instead of going for my wildest technical
dreams - when I want to <a href="/2021/06/18/when-scope-blows-up/">blow up the scope</a>,
but they won't allow me, <em>I dream of the terrible things I'd do with their
money</em>.</p>
<h2>The Utopia of Creative Freedom</h2>
<p>I dream of the freedom to work on what I think is right - for how long I think
is good.</p>
<p>I dream of not owing responsibility to my employers or financiers. The utopia
of creative freedom, where no budget limitations, no sense of scarcity, or fear
of failure exists.</p>
<p>I dream of a place where financiers understand my desire to take risks, a place
where not only engineers have empathy towards the business but vice versa.</p>
<p>It's there where I'd waste <em>your</em> hard-earned dollars on days of &quot;unnecessary&quot;
and tangential work.</p>
<p>It's where I'd rent servers to compute seemingly useless shit - where I'd blow
tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere just to gather more, to you,
<em>irrelevant information</em>.</p>
<p>If I had all the creative freedom in the world, I'd do &quot;terrible&quot; things with
the money you invested.</p>
