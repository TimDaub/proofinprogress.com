    <h1>What happened at Gitcoin's Schelling Point event?</h1>
<p>I'm writing these lines with severe dark circles induced by
+7h jetlag and intense crypto conference networking.
Today's my second day in Denver, and by being an early
bird, I got the chance to participate in Gitcoin's
ETHDenver satellite event called &quot;Schelling Point.&quot; In this
post, as in the one yesterday, I reflect on my experiences
at the event.</p>
<p>I'll start with my day's first highlight, which was the
building the event took place. Called &quot;the Sports Castle,&quot;
and indeed seemingly passing the &quot;castle glance,&quot; is a
building on Denver's capitol hill that, on closer internal
inspection, turns out to be a converted parking garage-made
event venue.</p>
<p>While the first floor's low ceiling makes for a partially
awkward viewing experience of the stage, the former vehicle
ramps and the building's compactness create an interesting
event vibe. Walking through cheaply assembled crypto
startup booths in a former parking garage made my mind
wander.</p>
<p>But Am I now doing architecture reviews? Yes and no. I
think I want to mention the space's feel as I found it to
be comically opposed to the space's ascribed value. I've
overheard today that Ethereum's chain alone harbors over
$2T in assets today: And still, its community meets in an
abandoned parking garage.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, this image of technical
misappropriation, although that term may be too negatively
connotated in the English language, provides an interesting
segue into some conversations I overheard today: Namely
that the crypto-verse and particularly Ethereum with its
programmable money allows developers to create
non-skeuomorphic digital experiences. So if in the real
world, a parking garage can become a crypto event's venue,
why shouldn't Bored Apes take Rolex's place?</p>
<p>This idea was further underlined by the event's
participants and some conversations I had. While there's a
mutual understanding that buying digital sneakers for a
metaverse pod is rather skeuomorphic, that line of thinking
isn't representative of the fact that on the metaverse, you
can be anything: even a boat that chooses to wear Nike's.</p>
<p>But it's true: Within the blockchain, given our hyper
normalized suffering, we've re-built private property laws
skeumorphically. User's don't have to occupy the property
to continue owning it; it can't and must not be taken away
forcefully. The individual and their consent ultimately
determine pricing before the sale. As a Harberger
maximalist, what comes to mind then is that we've
reimplemented private property monopolies without truly
ever questioning them. So indeed, it is time to dare and
design non-skeuomorphism.</p>
<p>I, for one, appreciate the call for &quot;getting weird(er)&quot;
[again] and the renewed commitment of the space to both
empirical test and theoretically research what works.
Besides that, I didn't take much more from Vitalik's talk.
He should have mentioned, though, that what they've all
done with shipping ETH2.0 is a great example of both
empirical and theoretical work going hand-in-hand. Kudos to
everyone that worked on ETH2. You're about to make it!</p>
<p>Today's event at Denver's Sports Castle was incredibly
intense and worthwhile the visit. I hate to reduce it to
the following, but after two years of not making the crazy
crypto conference mingling experience, I can proudly say
that today, though I'm incredibly exhausted, I feel
accomplished and happy for having been able to participate.
This felt great!</p>
<p>And in case they've been recorded and will be released
online, I can recommend the following talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitalik's keynote speech on empirical and theoretical work</li>
<li>Beth Mccarthy's &quot;Building regenerative culture.&quot;</li>
<li>The panel on &quot;Regenerative Cryptoeconomics.&quot;</li>
<li>Glen Weyl's talk on &quot;Plurality.&quot;</li>
</ul>
