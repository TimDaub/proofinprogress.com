    <h1>How To Use Emscripten &amp; WASM in Web Apps</h1>
<p>A year ago, I published a post about <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">how I built WASM
SYNTH</a>. As I learned a lot
during the process, the post ended up becoming huge. I even ended up putting a
whole section in the post's appendix.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, a friend of mine asked me about my opinion on emscripten, the
tool I had used to build <a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth">WASM SYNTH</a>.
Coincidentally, I ended up referring him to the WASM SYNTH post's
<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/#appendix">appendix</a>, where I
had described my build pipeline in detail.</p>
<p>Today, it made me realize that I could publish that appendix as an individual
post. And so that what I ended up doing. In the following sections, you'll
learn about the build process that I'm using in the WASM SYNTH project.</p>
<p>&quot;How do I integrate WebAssembly into my regular web app build without bloating
it too much?&quot; I wondered when I first started working with WebAssembly. To put
things into perspective: I had just recently switched from Webpack to rollup.js
as I was sick of spending hours setting up Webpack with its ten thousand magic
configuration options.</p>
<p>To my surprise, however, neither framework has reasonable defaults for handling
WebAssembly yet. Notably, when we generated the WebAssembly outputs using
emscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grew bigger than
4KB</a>. But
there were other problems too:</p>
<ul>
<li>rollup.js bundles all source file into a single JavaScript file.</li>
<li>Booting the app, also means booting react.js, which itself starts a continuous
process that we'll somehow have to take into account.</li>
<li>emscripten generates a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code> file. The <code>.wasm</code> file contains
all C++ source code as well as WebAssembly instructions. The <code>.js</code> file acts
as the glue between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
<ul>
<li>In some cases, there's this 4KB size limit on loading <code>.wasm</code> files</li>
<li>The emscripten <code>.js</code> glue code is super useful. I can recommend including
it into your code deliverable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>AudioWorklet</code> is supposed to be included into the page by using <code>new AudioContext().addModule(&lt;path&gt;)</code> - It has a separate global scope. But emscripten's glue code relies on the
global scope too (<code>Module</code> object)</li>
<li>Rollup.js doesn't have good defaults or plugins for bundling
emscripten-generated <code>.wasm</code> code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, this led me to build a custom pipeline to bundle emscripten builds
every time my source changed. But before I explain how, let's take a step back
to understand how emscripten's compilation works.</p>
<p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called <code>emcc</code> into
the shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let's try compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning of the post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;

using namespace emscripten;

std::string hello() {
  return &quot;hello world&quot;;
}

// NOTE: Using embind, we can define `hello`'s external name
EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS(my_module) {
  function(&quot;hello&quot;, &amp;hello);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make it executable by a browser, we'll use <code>emcc</code> to compile it to a <code>.wasm</code>
and a <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ emcc main.cc --bind -WASM=1 -o main.js
</code></pre>
<p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in <code>main.cc</code> into a
<code>main.wasm</code> file. Besides, it also generates this glue code (<code>main.js</code>) using
<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html">Embind</a>.
It allows us to invoke functions, initially written in C++, directly from
within JavaScript as if they were just regular classes. So to make emscripten's
outputs work correctly, we'll have to include the <code>.js</code> into the page. On the
initialization of the page, emscripten's clue code is loading the <code>.wasm</code> file
asynchronously. Through some trick, the browser skips the 4KB file size limit,
and all our C++ classes are now available as native JS classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;wasm/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      Module.onRuntimeInitialized = function () {
        console.log(Module.hello());
      };
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good. But, as I've mentioned previously, one of the problems now is that
the <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in a separate thread with a separate global
scope, won't be aware of emscripten's <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export code
from within a Worklet?</p>
<p>After spending quite some time researching that question, I discovered that the
Google Chrome Labs team
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>
transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">native
modules</a>
and then simply use ES6's <code>import from</code> syntax. Well, it turns out the JS
modules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn't widely supported
yet</a>,
particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, let alone <code>Worklets</code>...</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JS modules and
other fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisingly simple trick.</p>
<p>I reduce emscripten's outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file that contains the <code>.wasm</code>
as base64 string using it's <code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten's
<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the <code>AudioWorklet</code>'s global scope, I
then simply append the emscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>'
JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. That allows me to
execute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using the poorly supported
<code>import from</code> syntax. Ultimately, I ended up with the following bash script (or
on
<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth/blob/master/scripts/build.sh">GitHub</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

DIR=&quot;.wasm&quot;

# NOTE: Generates the .wasm directory if it doesn't exist yet.
if [ ! -d $DIR ]; then
  mkdir $DIR
fi

# NOTE `-std`: To use modern c++11 features like std::tuple and std::vector,
# we need to enable C++ 11 by passing the parameter to clang through emcc.
emcc src/cpp/*.cc \
  -std=c++11 \
  -O1 \
  -s WASM=1 \
  -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \
  -s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 \
  -s SINGLE_FILE=1 \
  -s MODULARIZE=1 \
  --bind \
  -o $DIR/main.js

# NOTE: We concat the emscripten generated js and wasm file with the worklet
# such that we don't have to import it later as an es6 module. This
# achieves better cross-browser compatibility.
cat $DIR/main.js src/js/worklets/synth.js &gt; public/worklets/synth.js

<p>To update the page every time the source changed, I additionally used
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-watch"><code>npm-watch</code></a> to re-run the routine
each time file changes occur.</p>
