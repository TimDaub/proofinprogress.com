    <h1>Smart Contracts are the Programmable Commons</h1>
<p>[<a href="https://youtu.be/-xreeHzlpYE">Listen to the audio version on Youtube</a>]</p>
<p>Ethereum's smart contracts allow developers, for the first time in history, to
build ownership experiences residing in the commons. Traditional cloud
platforms like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure are built on the assumption of
privately owned property and hence also taking on responsibility and liability
in computing. A rented server running a program orchestrated by an individual
will always necessitate seeking those to be held accountable.</p>
<p>Decentralized smart contracts, owned and controlled by no single natural or
juristic person, hosted by no particular individual, do not look or feel like
private property. They are collectively maintained, hosted, administrated, and
run; they ARE the commons.</p>
<p>Deploying a simple stateful contract on Ethereum that carries no codified
notion of specifically-added ownership is not hosted by anyone in particular.
Its deployment can be orchestrated such that no individual could be observed as
&quot;the deployer.&quot; A contract's existence is solidified through its data's block
inclusion. Its data is continuously and neutrally made available as part of all
data being on-chain available. No one individual could be observed as the
operator or controller of such a contract.</p>
<p>A contract's execution is not directly controllable. Unless specified, its
lifetime is not limited. A message call invokes a contract's public and
external functions. Its computation is redundantly run by any individual block
producer on the network. Not by some, but by anyone participating in the
network.</p>
<p>No individual block producer or full node executes the message call. Though
transactions are prioritized through payment, all nodes are obligated to return
the one deterministic result. There is no one individual responsible, liable,
or accountable for delivering on the call.</p>
<p>Ethereum's smart contracts are the programmable commons as they truly allow
property to transcend into the common realm. Since smart contracts are, as
outlined above, an instrument residing in the commons, giving them ownership
over other property allows it to transcend into the commons too.</p>
<p>Properly configured common ownership contracts do not allow property escaping
into private possession either. Physical and commonly-owned property configured
through paper contracts, on the contrary, allow transcendence into the hands of
private owners.</p>
<p>Arguably, a stone on the bottom of the Atlantic ocean is commonly owned by all
creatures on earth capable or willing to exercise the common property concept.
Similarly, in some countries, at least, so is water. This quality not only
implies shared responsibility for the objects in question, it also asks for
mutually-assumed liability. Indeed, shared property requires normative
behavior.</p>
<p>It means that no one single co-owner of a partially owned water source is
entitled to make decisions. At the risk of polluting the water source, all
interactions with it require normative action, as the only acceptable behavior
is one that can potentially become a mutually agreed-upon rule for all.</p>
<p>If they dare, the private owner, both legally and morally, is capable of
polluting their possession: the water source. If they, through their will,
decide to do it, and if it is their property, we have agreed to allow it under
private property law.</p>
<p>It is important to realize how different common ownership experiences are and
how little practical governing experience we all have. It is also important to
understand that the transcendence of property between the two realms is, as
already claimed prior, a possibility.</p>
<p>Nobody's stone can become someones. Moral, law, history, and recourse help
define over time who owns what. On Ethereum, that is similar but different.</p>
<p>Here, given its pristine unregulated nature, smart contract developers are not
necessarily bound to use the standard societal constructs of private property.
As smart contracts themselves symbolize already an instrument in the realm of
the commons, and since neither the legal system nor recourse is strictly
required or capable of governing possession, blockchain property may never be
directly controllable, albeit logically still exist outside of a vacuum.</p>
<p>Besides private property, common property or new forms like Harberger property,
code, similar to prose and imagination, can extend towards any shape or form of
non-skeuomorphic property.</p>
<p>No matter the view of legal advisors on the subject matter and their desire to
seek skeuomorphic comparisons for rational regulation: Today, with systems like
Ethereum, completely new forms of digital (and atomic?) ownership experiences
are possible that will necessarily challenge the fundamental assumptions of
price discovery, evaluation, supply and demand economics, and the legal system.</p>
