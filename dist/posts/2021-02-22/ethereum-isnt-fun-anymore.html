    <h1>Ethereum isn't fun anymore</h1>
<p><strong>Ethereum isn't fun anymore. There I said it.</strong> And although, the last
time I developed an app using it has been more than a year ago, I stand by
my word. <strong>Developing dapps on Ethereum has become annoying</strong>. Here's why:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/pedro.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>I used Ethereum before it was cool.</h2>
<p>I know; it's such a hipster statement. But it's true. Ethereum has stopped
being edgy. It has transitioned out of its niche to build a world computer.
Its community has become huge, and I stopped knowing most faces. Where there
was a feeling of revolution and new beginnings, now there are people in suits
talking corporate. Within just a few years, it went from <a href="https://github.com/DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy">DAI
daddys</a> and only <a href="https://www.molochdao.com/">half-ironic satanist
cults</a> to lending, insurance, and trade protocols.</p>
<p>&quot;What's Ethereum's killer app?&quot; we asked ourselves not long ago. Now we know.
It's the world's best publicly-accessible settlement platform for financial
transactions. In a way, that's exciting. The markets think so too. But for
anyone else that worked with Ethereum but outside of financial applications,
it's somewhat of a letdown.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/homer.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>How do you do, fellow Ethereans?</h2>
<p>I think it must have been around the time of the last big crypto bubble
when Monero enthusiasts called for &quot;Making Monero cheap again.&quot;</p>
<p>Monero, being the anonymous digital currency that had indeed just legit use
cases apart from the occasional rumors that entangled it in drug
trafficking, had suddenly become too expensive for everyday use. Realizing
the glaring threat of becoming too valuable, its core developers went on to
fix the problem by campaigning at CoinDesk's yearly industry gathering
Consensus.</p>
<p>They announced the &quot;Monero Enterprise Alliance.&quot; An inside joke,
supposed to piss off other projects that had started to take themselves too
seriously. Being slightly confused that day myself, I now can't recall if
the effort had ever been successful. But in any case, I can't recommend
buying Monero. It's useless.</p>
<h2>Gas prices are too damn high!</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/deepfried_high_rents.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a phase in my short career as an Ethereum developer where I looked at
Etherscan's &quot;<a href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Verified Contracts</a>&quot; page
all day long to find vulnerabilities in newly uploaded contracts. &quot;My name's Tim
and I'm an etherholic!&quot;</p>
<p>It was addictive. I ended up calling a few of those contracts, failing to cause
any havoc, sadly. But it was so much fun! Back when transaction fees were still
affordable on Ethereum, building projects was great. We started up Ganache and
our favorite text editor (vim). The only choice we had was Solidity. And off
we went.</p>
<p>Now, building Ethereum applications has become painful. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid
idea</a>. Layer 2 isn't ready. Neither
is Eth 2.0. And there are still <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">many reasons to NOT ship to a Proof of
Authority network</a>. Finally, gas
prices are too damn high!</p>
<p>How do we move on from here?</p>
<h2>I need a hero.</h2>
<p><strong>I need a hero, and by that, I mean that I need a usable methodology for
building scaleable decentralized apps.</strong> Yes, you've heard that right. We don't
need more &quot;Ethereum killers&quot; that can do 10x more tx/s than Ethereum. Those
are useless.</p>
<p>Instead, we need an approach for the average Joe developer to create their idea
within the Ethereum ecosystem without the need for hardcore unproven
technologies. I know, you Vitalik will say: &quot;Oh, it's not a problem, we can has
'<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html">Garbled Circuits</a>' and
zkrollups.&quot; But I'm telling you that no sane Joe will touch that shit without a
serious cryptographic specialist by their side.</p>
<p>We want what we stayed for initially: Good ol smart contracts. But right now,
they're too damn expensive to innovate.</p>
