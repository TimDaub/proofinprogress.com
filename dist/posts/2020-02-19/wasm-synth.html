<h2>The Presentation</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ever since I started taking piano lessons two years ago, I was curious to take
a look into a vastly different field from cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
That field being digital audio engineering. So when some of my freelance
projects ended in November 2019, I decided to allocate my next three months
towards building an audio product.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered what I wanted to build: A synthesizer. In C++! I had just
watched some talks on WebAssembly, and was very curious to learn a new language
too! In hindsight, the personal challenge, however, was to understand the data
structures and math that go into generating audio.</p>
<p>That's the story of how I rediscovered the beauty of mathematics through
building a synthesizer with C++ and WebAssembly.</p>
<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>I had never done anything in the field of music technology - I had to start
at zero practically. It meant I had to look at the physical, mathematical,
and musical fundamentals of audio generation.</p>
<h3>The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem</h3>
<p>Sound is a time-dependent phenomenon. Regular instruments take advantage of
this phenomenon by emitting sound waves over time through, e.g., a mechanical
part oscillating. That produces a time-continuous analog signal, which means
that for each point in time, the signal produces a unique value in amplitude.
Computers can merely approximate analog values by sampling them into
time-discrete values. They're so good at approximating that the digital
representation of an analog signal virtually becomes indistinguishable to a
human's ear. As long as the sampling complies with some basic rules of signal
processing, at least.</p>
<p>A pretty fundamental principle in this regard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist–Shannon sampling
theorem</a>.
It states that to capture all necessary information from a continuous-time
signal, a function <em>&quot;sampling&quot;</em> the signal needs to record data at least at a
rate twice as frequently as the highest frequency. If this requirement is
unfulfilled, then the resulting digital signal contains an artifact called
<em>&quot;Aliasing&quot;</em>, distorting the familiarity of the original signal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sawtooth-aliasingdemo.ogg">Listen to
this sound bit of aliasing happening on a sawtooth
wave</a>).</p>
<p>Though we're not planning to record analog signal to digital, we'll still have
to comply with this theorem, as synthesizing sound is nothing more than filling
a list with time-discrete values too<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>. Practically,
it may look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Simple pseudo code noise generator

context = new AudioContext()
samples = []

for (i = 0; i &lt; context.sampleRate; i++) {
  // Generate noise
  samples.append(random.choice([0, 1]))
}

// We've generated enough samples for exactly 1 second.
// The output will hence be 1 second of noise.
context.play(samples)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we're initiating a new <code>AudioContext</code> object, getting its sample rate,
and generating enough samples to have the noise last for at least one second.
Admittedly, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem is less of a problem here, as the
<code>sampleRate</code> is likely to be set to a reasonable value by our pseudo language's
magical <code>AudioContext</code>. But assuming it was set to only 200 Hertz, outputting a
piano's middle C (its frequency is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies">261.6256
Hertz</a>) would already be
corrupted, as the required 261 repetitions per second to output middle C
wouldn't fit into the 200 repetitions per second of the sample rate.
Practically, what would happen is that our sampling algorithm would be
&quot;overtaken&quot; by middle C's frequency and hence output a shifted version. The
figure below nicely visualizes the effect, showing what happens if we're
gradually increasing the signal's frequency at a steady sampling rate.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/nyquist.png" alt="Undersampling: The signal's frequency is increased while the sampling rate (dotted line) remains steady."></p>
<p>But assuming a sufficient sampling rate, there's another problem with the above
code. Imagine, we substituted the noise-producing snippet with a nice-sounding
sine wave and then integrated and sold it as a hardware synthesizer. When
pressing a key, the player would hear the respective tone for a second.
Pressing another key, they'd hear another tone for another second and so on.
But since we built our function only to generate static-length tones of a
one-second length, it wouldn't be much fun making music, as playing rhythmic
patterns would be impossible!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/frames.png" alt="Large buffer sizes can introduce latency for the user6."></p>
<p>That's because music doesn't work on an absolute time scale, but on a relative
one. We wouldn't say that a note &quot;lasts for a second&quot;. Instead, we'd say it
&quot;lasts for a quarter bar&quot; and, hence, call it a &quot;quarter note&quot;. To build a
software instrument, this means that we'll have to optimize for real-time
responsiveness and maximum expressiveness. For this, we'll need specific data
structures.</p>
<h3>Frames and Ring Buffers</h3>
<p>Generally, audio in programming languages is most commonly generated by
continuously filling up buffers with data points and then sending them to the
sound card. But as we've just learned, that buffer's size determines the
responsiveness of our instrument. An idea that nicely dissolves this problem is
to chunk our buffer into <em>frames</em>. Instead of sending a fixed-length buffer of
samples to the output device, we chunk it into small <em>frames</em> and continuously
send these. In theory, we'd limit the size of a frame to a single sample for
maximum responsiveness, meaning we'd now be <em>&quot;streaming&quot;</em> our data. But given
that timing is crucial too, we'll have to come up with yet another strategy for
sending just the right amount of data in a given time frame. For this, we can
use a different concept called a <em>&quot;ring buffer&quot;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/ring-buffer.gif" alt="A ring buffer processing a keyboard's inputs."></p>
<p>A ring buffer is a fixed-size list, managed by two distinct pointers, where one
pointer is writing values, and the other one is &quot;chasing&quot; and consuming those
values. It allows a program to continuously stream data, precisely at the
speed of the chasing pointer. Additionally, it provides developers with a
<em>&quot;pull&quot;</em> rather than a <em>&quot;push&quot;</em> API. Now, instead of having to optimize their
program to push new frames to the output device periodically, a developer can
use the callback function of a ring buffer's writing pointer to be notified
about a shortage of fresh data.</p>
<p>But so much for theory. Let's explore how we can implement these concepts in
practice.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>As we've discussed the most important theoretical concepts in the previous
section, we can now move into the implementation phase. Specifically, we'll
highlight three distinct issues that we had to overcome.</p>
<h3>Using the <code>AudioWorklet</code></h3>
<p>Today, there's sadly no cross-browser API fully implementing all the above
concepts. That requires <em>some</em> improvisation when trying to build a synthesizer
for the web. Naively, one might think that <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> allow
one to implement a ring buffer quickly. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29972322/1263876">their accuracy can't be
trusted</a><sup
id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>. Alternatively, there's the web audio API's
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ScriptProcessorNode"><code>ScriptProcessorNode</code></a>.
And while it allows hooking into the output device's streaming process, it
still requires a <em>push</em> approach, as inserting just the right amount of samples
per second into the output stream is kept to the developer. Additionally,
<code>ScriptProcessorNode</code> has been deprecated without any reasonable cross-browser
compatible alternative available since 2014. Yikes!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.mecheye.net/2017/09/i-dont-know-who-the-web-audio-api-is-designed-for/">So what
now?</a>
Luckily, <code>ScriptProcessorNode</code>'s deprecation happened years ago already. Since
then, the browser vendors have worked on an alternative, called the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet"><code>AudioWorklet</code></a>.
Encouragingly, it implements what we described above; a pull interface<sup
id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> spawned in a separate thread (hence <code>Worklet</code>) for
lag-free audio processing.</p>
<p>Let's convert our previous code snippet to an <code>AudioWorklet</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">class NoiseWorklet extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    const outputChannel = outputs[0][0];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; outputChannel.length; i++) {
      outputChannel[i] = Math.round(Math.random());
    }
    return true;
  }
}

registerProcessor(&quot;NoiseWorklet&quot;, SynthWorklet);
</code></pre>
<p>And take a closer look! First, we extend our class with the
<code>AudioWorkletProcessor</code> interface class and implement the mandatory
<code>process(inputs, output, parameter)</code> function. <code>process</code> allows us to access
all currently available audio <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> and <em>process</em> them. We
won't have to add them to the function's <code>return</code> statement, as we're
manipulating them by reference. Conveniently, <code>process</code> is called for us by the
<code>AudioWorklet</code> every time the output device needs data.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding, it really helped me think of the <code>AudioWorklet</code> as a
ring buffer. It's implementation isn't a ring buffer. But that metaphor served
me well for getting a better intuition.</p>
<p>An important detail to consider is that, at the time of writing, the
<code>AudioWorklet</code> API is, sadly, only supported by a handful of browsers. A
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/audioworklet-polyfill">polyfill</a> is
available. As its master branch and npm release were buggy though, I had to
submit a
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/audioworklet-polyfill/pull/21">PR</a> first
before being able to use it. Thanks, Google Chrome team.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got everything working cross-browser and was able to move on
to more exciting things!</p>
<h3>The Math of Audio Generation</h3>
<p>One of the most daunting tasks of the project was having to deal with the math
to generate audio. After all, the last time I had worked with frequencies was
back in high school physics class and, more recently, in some computer science
lectures. In all honesty, though, I had to start from scratch as I had
forgotten almost everything! So for this section, I'll establish a particular
formula in great detail as creating it was necessary to come up with a
functioning product.</p>
<p>I began by <a href="https://hackmd.io/fR86Sw1nSFGdeFmgirt7qw#Math">playing around</a>
with sine waves in jsbin.com and quickly realized that I had to go back even
further, by, for example, looking up the definition of a frequency and by
researching the period length of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">sin(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.

<p>The first <em>actual</em> mathematical problem I encountered was when I tried to
render a tone for a given MIDI key dynamically. MIDI keys are tuned by
assigning each note to an ascending integer. This integer can then be run
through a formula to receive the respective frequency in Hertz. Notes exist as
frequency values for waveforms. The MIDI formula I found defined:</p>

<p>&quot;So can there be a formula to produce samples given a MIDI key number?&quot;, I
asked myself. And even though I was a bit overwhelmed after my first
mathematical research, I was able to come up with something useful. Given a
sample rate <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">σ</span></span></span></span> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)">440 Hertz

simplify it. First off, I think it's important to know the intention behind
designing this function. As I said, it's purpose is to generate sample values

that there's a formula to generate a frequency value from a MIDI key index. And

<p>After creating this first formula, I had passed the local
mathematical-insecurity hump, and proudly ventured ahead, trying to solve more
elaborate problems!</p>
<h3>Working with WebAssembly and C++</h3>
<p>Finally, I feel like I need to say a few things in this post about WebAssembly
and C++ too. It turns out, that was the most natural part! Yes, being a
JavaScript developer, C++ looked foreign at first, and I was a bit scared of
pointers, and the raw-ness C++ radiated. But, overall, it wasn't entirely new
territory for me as I already understood many of its concepts from previous
projects (e.g., working with the shell or Ethereum Solidity). To kickstart
development, I bought &quot;Accelerated C++&quot; by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. I
read parts of it but then dove fully into coding. The book is excellent. I can
recommend it!</p>
<p>The same goes for emscripten and WebAssembly. There are a few gotchas, and I'm
writing about one particular in the Appendix of this post. Overall,
WebAssembly's tooling is already surprisingly usable and easily integrated into
a standard front end build pipeline.</p>
<p>I had initially decided on C++ and WASM for the performance boost. Now, I take
much more joy out being able to separate my code base by concerns nicely.
Writing all audio code in C++ and all user interface code in JavaScript led to
a loose coupling and nice modularization. I noticed that I not only wrote a
fully-fledged audio library in C++ through this but also that it's portable to
anywhere WebAssembly runs! That's super cool!</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>WASM Synth turned out to be a great learning experience. Working as a developer
in the same field for many years, it's sometimes easy to forget how amazing the
brain reacts to learning new things. In November, after having worked on smart
contracts and decentralized apps for more than a year, I wasn't much confident
anymore in cutting my teeth at math. I felt like I stood no chance in
succeeding in writing a program outputting audio. But spending some time doing
it, I noticed once again that, like most human-made things, they're limited in
their complexity and that enough time-allocation and intrinsic motivation help
immensely permeating them.</p>
<p>The math involved, parts of which I outlined in this post, really put me out of
my comfort zone. But finally, spending time working towards a practical
solution helped me fill in the gaps in my knowledge. In the future, I'd like
to make an even more conscious effort involving more of it in my daily coding!</p>
<p>Lastly, the thesis that many concepts can be mastered playfully by reverse
engineering their core problems once again proved to be right, but probably not
unchallenged for too long as I'm looking for new projects putting me out of my
comfort zone (hire me<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>).</p>

<h3>The <code>emscripten</code> Build Pipeline</h3>
<p>A question I had before working with emscripten was: &quot;How do I integrate
WebAssembly into my regular web app build, without bloating it too much?&quot;. To
put things into perspective: I had just recently switched from Webpack to
rollup.js as I was sick of spending hours setting up Webpack with its ten
thousand magic configuration options.</p>
<p>To my surprise, however, neither framework has reasonable defaults for handling
WebAssembly yet. Notably, when we generated the WebAssembly outputs using
emscripten and they <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/loading-wasm">grew bigger than
4KB</a>. But
there were other problems too:</p>
<ul>
<li>rollup.js bundles all source file into a single JavaScript file.</li>
<li>Booting the app, also means booting react.js, which itself starts a continuous
process that we'll somehow have to take into account.</li>
<li>emscripten generates a <code>.wasm</code> and a <code>.js</code> file. The <code>.wasm</code> file contains
all C++ source code as well as WebAssembly instructions. The <code>.js</code> file acts
as the glue between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
<ul>
<li>In some cases, there's this 4KB size limit on loading <code>.wasm</code> files</li>
<li>The emscripten <code>.js</code> glue code is super useful. I can recommend including
it into your code deliverable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>AudioWorklet</code> is supposed to be included into the page by using <code>new AudioContext().addModule(&lt;path&gt;)</code> - It has a separate global scope. But emscripten's glue code relies on the
global scope too (<code>Module</code> object)</li>
<li>Rollup.js doesn't have good defaults or plugins for bundling
emscripten-generated <code>.wasm</code> code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, this led me to build a custom pipeline to bundle emscripten builds
every time my source changed. But before I explain how, let's take a step back
to understand how emscripten's compilation works.</p>
<p>On installation, emscripten exports a command-line utility called <code>emcc</code> into
the shell. To demonstrate its capabilities, let's try compiling the <code>Hello World</code> example from the beginning of the post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c++">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;emscripten/bind.h&gt;

using namespace emscripten;

std::string hello() {
  return &quot;hello world&quot;;
}

// NOTE: Using embind, we can define `hello`'s external name
EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS(my_module) {
  function(&quot;hello&quot;, &amp;hello);
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make it executable by a browser, we'll use <code>emcc</code> to compile it to a <code>.wasm</code>
and a <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ emcc main.cc --bind -WASM=1 -o main.js
</code></pre>
<p><code>emcc</code> here simply compiles all functions contained in <code>main.cc</code> into a
<code>main.wasm</code> file. Besides, it also generates this glue code (<code>main.js</code>) using
<a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html">Embind</a>.
It allows us to invoke functions, initially written in C++, directly from
within JavaScript as if they were just regular classes. So to make emscripten's
outputs work correctly, we'll have to include the <code>.js</code> into the page. On the
initialization of the page, emscripten's clue code is loading the <code>.wasm</code> file
asynchronously. Through some trick, the browser skips the 4KB file size limit,
and all our C++ classes are now available as native JS classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;wasm/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      Module.onRuntimeInitialized = function () {
        console.log(Module.hello());
      };
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good. But, as I've mentioned previously, one of the problems now is that
the <code>AudioWorklet</code>, being spawned in a separate thread with a separate global
scope, won't be aware of emscripten's <code>window.Module</code>. So how do we export code
from within a Worklet?</p>
<p>After spending quite some time researching that question, I discovered that the
Google Chrome Labs team
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/blob/master/audio-worklet/design-pattern/wasm/index.html">recommends</a>
transpiling all JavaScript source into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">native
modules</a>
and then simply use ES6's <code>import from</code> syntax. Well, it turns out the JS
modules syntax <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">isn't widely supported
yet</a>,
particularly not in <code>Workers</code>, let alone <code>Worklets</code>...</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/import-support.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But luckily, after banging my head another few days against JS modules and
other fancy new front end frameworks, I found a surprisingly simple trick.</p>
<p>I reduce emscripten's outputs to a single <code>.js</code> file that contains the <code>.wasm</code>
as base64 string using it's <code>-s SINGLE_FILE=1</code> option. As we need emscripten's
<code>.js</code> file to define <code>window.Module</code> in the <code>AudioWorklet</code>'s global scope, I
then simply append the emscripten JavaScript file with the <code>AudioWorklet</code>'
JavaScript file to make them configure the same global scope. That allows me to
execute WebAssembly from within a Worklet without using the poorly supported
<code>import from</code> syntax. Ultimately, I ended up with the following bash script (or
on
<a href="https://github.com/TimDaub/wasm-synth/blob/master/scripts/build.sh">GitHub</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

DIR=&quot;.wasm&quot;

# NOTE: Generates the .wasm directory if it doesn't exist yet.
if [ ! -d $DIR ]; then
  mkdir $DIR
fi

# NOTE `-std`: To use modern c++11 features like std::tuple and std::vector,
# we need to enable C++ 11 by passing the parameter to clang through emcc.
emcc src/cpp/*.cc \
  -std=c++11 \
  -O1 \
  -s WASM=1 \
  -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \
  -s BINARYEN_ASYNC_COMPILATION=0 \
  -s SINGLE_FILE=1 \
  -s MODULARIZE=1 \
  --bind \
  -o $DIR/main.js

# NOTE: We concat the emscripten generated js and wasm file with the worklet
# such that we don't have to import it later as an es6 module. This
# achieves better cross-browser compatibility.
cat $DIR/main.js src/js/worklets/synth.js &gt; public/worklets/synth.js

<p>To update the page every time the source changed, I additionally used
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-watch"><code>npm-watch</code></a> to re-run the routine
each time file changes occur.</p>
