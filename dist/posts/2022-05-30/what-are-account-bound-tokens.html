<h2>What are Soulbound tokens?</h2>
<p>Ever since <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html">Vitalik Buterin's first post on Soulbound
tokens</a>, Weyl, Ohlhaver
and Buterin then followed up with a paper titled &quot;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society:
Finding Web3's
Soul</a>.&quot;
Subsequently, but also before, many efforts spawned to implement their proposed
roadmap: Here are just some of the on-going ones: <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">&quot;Account-bound&quot;
(ABTs)</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5114">&quot;Soulbound&quot;
(SBTs)</a>, <a href="https://erc1238.notion.site/">&quot;non-transferrable&quot;
(NTTs)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5107">&quot;name-bound&quot;
(NBTs)</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4671">&quot;non-tradable&quot; tokens
(NTTs)</a> have been the focal point for
discussion in the Ethereum community.</p>
<p>As the topic is rather fresh off the press and since not many people have had
time to thoroughly think through some of the concepts proposed in Weyl et al.'s
paper, we, the authors of the Account-bound tokens specification
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>, have had to see several
uninformed takes we'd like to address with this post conclusively.</p>
<p>Additionally, since we stray of the the beaten path to define a original
financial primitive for EVM-chains, it's important that our work doesn't get
conflated with all the existing efforts. So this post serves as a living
knowledge base for all decisions made to develop EIP-4973 Account-bound tokens.</p>
<h2>What's our Methodology?</h2>
<p>Below, segmented in sections, are the most common misconceptions about
Account-bound tokens and how we think about them. And before we get into the
meat, please let us prefix the article by stating that we, too, are &quot;beginners&quot;
in this recently emergent field. But we're narrowly focused on delivering a
standard, so we believe we have a position and voice worth hearing in the
discussion.</p>
<p>We think a good primitive design intends to do one specific task in a precisely
defined and highly reliable fashion - this is one of the first principle
approaches we took with ABTs, i.e., how do we best bind tokens to accounts with
consideration of consent and recoverability in mind.</p>
<p>But before we dive into the misconceptions, let's define what we mean by
&quot;Account-bound tokens/property&quot;.</p>
<h2>What are Account-bound Tokens?</h2>
<p>To define where the terms &quot;soulbound&quot; and &quot;account-bound&quot; stem from, we have to
go back to their invention, namely to when World of Warcraft's game designers
intentionally took some items out of the world’s auction house market system to
prevent them from having a publicly-discovered price and limit their
accessibility.</p>
<p>Vanilla WoW’s “Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker” was one such
legendary item, and it required a forty-person raid, among other sub-tasks, to
slay the firelord “Ragnaros” to gain the “Essence of the Firelord,” a material
needed to craft the sword once.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/thunderfury.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon voluntary pickup, the sword permanently binds to a character’s “soul,”
making it impossible to trade, sell or even swap it between a player’s
characters.</p>
<p>In other words, “Thunderfury”’s price was the aggregate of all social costs
related to completing the difficult quest line with friends and guild members.
Other players spotting Thunderfuries could be sure their owner had slain
“Ragnaros,” the blistering firelord.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft players could trash legendary and soulbound items like the
Thunderfury to permanently remove them from their character.</p>
<h2>Why specify Account-bound Tokens?</h2>
<p>The Ethereum community has expressed a need for non-transferrable,
non-fungible, and socially-priced tokens similar to WoW’s soulbound items.
Popular contracts implicitly implement account-bound interaction rights today.</p>
<p>So similar to &quot;soulbound&quot; swords in World of Warcraft, an account-bound
token/property on Ethereum isn't sellable in any auction house. It cannot
be transferred from one user's account to another and so it doesn't have a
publicly-discoverable price.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> &quot;Account-bound
tokens&quot; defines a canonical Solidity interface for e.g. token wallet
implementers. A principled standardization helps interoperability and improves
on-chain data indexing.</p>
<p>Now, below is a discussion of the most common misconceptions of Account-bound
tokens.</p>
<h2>Misconception #1: EIP-4973 ABTs do discourage key rotation</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I see many people excited about non trade-able &quot;soul-bound&quot; tokens. But it can happen that you need to change your address due to one of many reasons:<br><br>- Better security<br> - software to hardware wallet<br> - new key derivation algorithm<br>- Key compromised<br>- Lost key<br><br>What do you do?</p>&mdash; Lefteris Karapetsas | Hiring for @rotkiapp (@LefterisJP) <a href="https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1530845615030251520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The most common concern we've heard when introducing the concept of binding
tokens to an account is that it discourages users from frequently rotating
keys. However, given the standard's current state and that revocation or
&quot;revocation and re-assignment&quot; are a possibility, the standard itself makes no
normative statements about an ABT being permanently bound to an account - even
in case of key loss.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite, while <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>
ABTs do indeed not implement
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a>'s <code>transfer</code> and
<code>transferFrom</code> functions, it's intentionally designed to leave the
responsibility of re-assignment and revocation up to the implementer, i.e., a
community, a protocol, a dApp, and not impose this as part of the primitive
itself.</p>
<p>But additionally, in the next paragraphs, we detail how Account-bound tokens
can further encourage key rotation and even help improve the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">social
recovery</a> of wallets.
It's because Account-bound tokens are really just the primitive to build social
wallets and so we can frame <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>
as a new token standard that introduces a non-normative and freely
implementable transfer functionality using attestations and revocations.</p>
<p>But that's a lot to unpack, so we'll do it separately in the following
sections.</p>
<h3>Preventative key rotation</h3>
<p>As the probability of a key's leak increases over time, preventative key
rotation is an established industry best practice. Users following such
practice hence retire old keys for newly created ones to minimize their
exposure to attacks. A common concern about account-bound tokens is that they
directly bind assets to a user's account (and hence their private key).</p>
<p>The argument is that when assets are inseparably-bound to an account, a user is
discouraged from rotating their keys frequently as it'd require a lot of effort
to revoke and re-assign their property to a new account.</p>
<p>And while this argument can easily be made theoretically, in practice, we'd like
to argue that it has to be made on a case-to-case basis.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of a smart contract binding an account-bound property
to a person's wallet, we'd assume the contract giving the person the
possibility to reassign their property under special conditions.</p>
<p>Indeed, depending on the university's ABT revocation and re-assignment process,
that'd discourage (very tedious process) or encourage (very lightweight) key
rotation.</p>
<p>To encourage preventative key rotation best practices, we think ABT issuers
should carefully design their re-assignment processes. We believe that users of
such services will eventually flock to those that implement the most fitting
models. But we don't believe there to be a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<h3>Dealing with publicly leaked keys</h3>
<p>Secondly, it's worth highlighting what happens to Account-bound tokens in the
case of a private key leaking e.g. publicly. Assuming the key-possessing
attacker can front-run any on-chain interaction, e.g., they could call
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>'s <code>function burn(uint256 _tokenId)</code> to non-consensually revoke the user's credentials. However, contrary
to e.g. ERC20 or ERC721 tokens, an attacker wouldn't necessarily be able to
steal an account's property as there's no permissionless transfer function
exposed.</p>
<p>But again, it depends on the specifics. If, e.g., ABTs are used by an
undercollateralized loan platform to determine the user's credit worthiness,
then yes, the attacker may be able to take out a loan under false premises.</p>
<p>However, having ABT-issuing institutions control the revocation and
re-assignment process may be beneficiary in case of leaked keys too.</p>
<p>A university, being asked to re-assign ABTs to a new account, may ask the
student for identity verification (e.g. a video call). So while an attacker may
still be able to front-run all of the user's on-chain interactions, depending on
the ABT-issuer's re-assignment process, they're not capable of passing their
identification process's threshold.</p>
<p>Finally, in a high-trust environment, e.g., when Account-bound tokens are used
to represent the owners of a Gnosis Safe, in case of a private key leak, the
clumsy user can talk to their peers off-channel to announce key leakage and
hence initiate the social account replacement procedure of the multi-signature
wallet.</p>
<h3>Enabling new use cases</h3>
<p>Finally, it's important to mention here: A consensus around account-binding of
tokens can enable a complete re-thinking of the significance of accounts. It
may just enable the opposite of what <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials</a> proponents often use as
<strong>the</strong> argument <strong>against</strong> Soulbound tokens: It could make <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#ethereum-accounts">Ethereum EOA
accounts</a> irrelevant.</p>
<p>Consider this: A Gnosis Safe multi-signature wallet that requires two-thirds
(2/3) of their owners for any on-chain interaction makes the leakage of a
single key less risky in terms of losing assets than if those were stored on
one person's EOA account.</p>
<p>It's because the Gnosis Safe is still fully functional with one compromised
key, assuming the non-compromised owners can safely communicate about the next
steps: revoking the publicly leaked key.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> is to
generalize the permissions/policies a Gnosis Safe is currently &quot;issuing&quot; to
owners into a canonical interface supported by an on-chain primitive that is parsable by wallets
and indexers.</p>
<p>So rather than discouraging frequent key rotation:
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> represents a reasonable
shot at getting rid of the messy leakiness of accounts and key management by
allowing technical innovation in the space of private and high-trust crypto
dapps like the Gnosis Safe or the MolochDAO.</p>
<h2>False expectation #2: EIP-4973 ABTs cannot be misused</h2>
<p>Yes, you're reading this correctly. We're not going to claim anything utopic
here. While the scope of an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1">Ethereum Improvement
Proposal</a> is far-reaching and powerful,
it's not magic, and it cannot prevent the myriad possibilities of misuse.
Similarly, e.g., IEEE RFC authors can hardly prevent others from being mean or
straight up abusive using email or HTTPS.</p>
<p>But let us be clear: None of Ethereum's infrastructure or standards currently
prevent misuse. If you want to dox someone's Ethereum account, there are
already many ways to do so. And controversially, there is not a single way to
delete that data. But, this is a discussion entirely out of scope for defining
a token standard interface for wallet implementers within the EIP process.</p>
<p>However, we do think it's necessary to evaluate our actions against the ten
principles of Self-Sovereign Identity
[<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/self-sovereign-identity-primer.md#ten-principles">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">2</a>].</p>
<h3>Right to Disassociate</h3>
<p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> implements a <code>function burn(uint256 _tokenId)</code> and requires it to be callable at any time by an ABT
owner to ensure their right to publicly disassociate (or in MolochDAO terms:
&quot;ragequit&quot;) themselves from what has been issued towards their account.</p>
<p>However, we also want to be conscious that consent in a constellation between
more than two individuals may become more complex than always prioritizing a
single person's will. Paper contracts between e.g. three persons exist where
one person's consent withholding can block decision-making of the two other
persons. So while it looks like the <code>function burn</code> enables consensual
interaction, that may only be true for a constellation of two persons - not
more.</p>
<h3>Right to Mint</h3>
<p>Similarly, we, the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> authors,
are aware of the problems that non-consensual minting can create. But using a
variant of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> structured data
hashing and signing, we believe an optionally-implementable <code>function mintWithPermit</code> can be implemented to allow an ABT receiver to
&quot;<a href="https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/lazy-minting/">lazy-mint</a>&quot; with an ABT
issuer's signed permission. Particularly one of us, Raphael, with Violet's
<a href="https://erc1238.notion.site/ERC1238-Approval-43b7967b27ff4119ab15b4279f0fa61c">ERC1238Approval
extension</a>,
has been looking into this technical possibility.</p>
<p>We'll update this post in the future to reflect our progress.</p>
<h3>Finally, a Word about Blockchains, Misuse and Laws</h3>
<p>Yes, blockchains store data practically <strong>forever</strong> (but consider
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444">EIP-4444</a>). And there have been
numerous amazing philosophical takes on the subject matter too. The best, in
our opinion, is Ribbonfarm's &quot;<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/05/25/blockchains-never-forget/">Blockchain's never
forget</a>&quot;
article, which accepts blockchain's &quot;dystopian&quot; property of immutable,
permanent data availability as a chance to rethink inter-human interaction.</p>
<p>Blockchains like Ethereum currently violate the EU's right to be forgotten. If
user data is stored on Ethereum by dapps, it may also violate the GDPR laws in
many cases. There is <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03513113/document">a debate about the
alegality</a> of
blockchains. And similarly, we think there's acceptance needed towards
understanding blockchain as <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/02/28/smart-contracts-are-programmable-commons/">so culturally diverse and
international/global</a>
that, e.g., the EU or US's local laws won't &quot;just&quot; cut it.</p>
<p>It is not to say that we shouldn't use those laws as guiding principles for
implementing technology. But, clearly, in the case of bringing up the abuse
potential of ABTs, the community should understand that any other token
standard or any other Ethereum transaction can also contain abusive information
linking to accounts. It's a problem with Ethereum, not within specific
standards.</p>
<p>So generally, we want to encourage more discussion around the topic: But we
also want to be clear: This isn't a problem limited to ABTs. It is a problem of
blockchains and should hence also be discussed on that level.</p>
<p>ABTs can be misused, and we must work on heuristics to maximally prevent
misuse. Within blockchains and generally for any modern and inter(net)-national
peer2peer protocol.</p>
<h2>Misconception #3: EIP-4973 ABTs are censorship-vulnerable</h2>
<p>Then, once someone understands that ABTs can be re-issued using a sequential
revocation and re-attestation, an accusation that has been brought up is that
ABTs are vulnerable to censorship, namely because the implementer is in the
position to control the re-issuance.</p>
<p>And while, of course, this argument can be easily made, e.g., in the above case
of a smart contract issuing an ownership deed to a person, what is vital to
understand is that the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>
account-bound token standard makes no normative statement about the conceptual
structure of an ABT minter or how they should be implemented.</p>
<h3>Censorship or Moderation/Curation?</h3>
<p>A naive implementation of a university using
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> tokens may indeed be
vulnerable to &quot;censorship.&quot; But that's because it's implemented fragilely and
would require alleging bad intent. It also touches upon the question: What
equates to &quot;censorship&quot; and what equates to &quot;moderation&quot;?</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, if e.g. a group wants to ban a person for misconduct and hence they
decide to not re-issue an ABT, that’s their choice. It’s not “censorship”
because they don’t carry mal-intent.</li>
<li>Secondly: If there’d be structural, mal-intended censorship of a group over
others (read: discrimination): That’d be bad and we should do anything
possible to avoid it!</li>
</ul>
<p>But we, the authors, are discordant on how to deal with structural censorship.
Some of us take the stance that technology must prevent harm. That's the
mainstream tech opinion where for example, social networks interfere actively.
While others of us say that immutable blockchain-documented misbehavior is
ultimately a good thing for accountability and not technology must prevent
harm but the respective legitimate jurisdictional system of a user.</p>
<h3>Building towards Credible Neutrality</h3>
<p>The censorship-vulnerability argument against ABTs is one that assumes a
worst-case scenario of mal-intended implementers. But the
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>'s document now even makes a
normative statement as a means to prevent mal-intended censorship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recommend implementing strictly decentralized, permissionless and
censorship-resistant re-issuance processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For making a visual example, let's imagine that a future metaverse land title
may not be emitted from a single person in control and power (read: &quot;Censorship
capability&quot;) but rather from an anarchist or democratically-organized smart
contract many people can coordinate with.</p>
<p>ABTs do not mandate a token issuer to be a centrally controlled and
censorship-vulnerable entity, and so the argument that ABTs are
censorship-vulnerable likely stems from being misinformed.</p>
<p>We should implement ABTs issuers in a decentralized fashion. We should properly
rethink how our trust-crediting institutions work. We should fit them into the
mold of the interfaces we have available. And if they don't fit: Let's change
or add new interfaces.</p>
<h2>Misconception #4: EIP-4973 ABTs are claims and should be stored off-chain.</h2>
<p>In her post &quot;<a href="https://katelynsills.com/blockchain/soulbound-tokens/">Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) Should Be Signed
Claims</a>&quot;, <a href="https://katelynsills.com/">Kate
Sills</a> makes the argument for why Soulbound tokens
are better to be stored off-chain as signed credentials.</p>
<p>By properly defining
&quot;signed claims&quot;, the post makes an important contribution to also narrow-down
Account-bound tokens: Namely because we're now acknowledging the coincidence of
EIP-4973 tokens being useful to issue on-chain credentials and at the same
time, because we've now become conscious of having to further distill our ABT
definition to distinguish ourselves.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create special ownership deeds or permission primitives; not
off-chain claims or credentials.</p>
<p><a href="https://katelynsills.com/">Sills</a>' definition of a claim is useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A claim is a statement that someone makes about themselves or someone else,
which may or may not be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An essential part of evaluating a claim is evaluating who made the claim,
their expertise, their experiences, and their motivations. The process of
evaluating a claim is very subjective and context-dependent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, <a href="https://katelynsills.com/">Sills</a>' outlines why statements complying to
the definitions above make no sense to be stored on-chain - we agree with her,
especially when evaluated through the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/self-sovereign-identity-primer.md#ten-principles">ten principles of self-soverein
identity</a>.
The following is an attempt and failure at complying to those principles by
pretending to store signed claims on-chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2. Control): Users must control their identity and utilizing on-chain
storage doesn't guarantee universal control as e.g. smart contracts can be
implemented <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0855B3B667Be89efcF9eE54a79aEcB25a194A8b0#code">in bad
ways</a>
and since e.g. claims may not be removable or costly to remove. Additionally,
while a user can technically store all of their Verifiable Credentials (which
are essentially JSON objects) in their &quot;data backpack&quot;, data storage on
Ethereum isn't in an individual's control and proposals like <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2026">EIP-2026: State
Rent H - Fixed Prepayment for
accounts</a> and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444">EIP-4444: Bound
Historical Data in Execution
Clients</a> can put the user's control
over their data in jeopardy. On the other hand, since Ethereum's public key
infrastructure allows users to spread control and mitigate compromization
risk, for some use cases, it may work quite well.</li>
<li>(5. Persistence): Identities must be long-lived but the upcoming
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444">EIP-4444</a> makes it clear that the
invariance to always have all data on Ethereum accessible will soon be
broken. With EIP-4444 implemented only chain state younger than a year will
be directly accessible. However, extrapolating from the past, Ethereum's data
is very persistent, up to the point where some may say it violates the EU's
&quot;Right to be Forgotten.&quot;</li>
<li>(6. Portability): Identity services must be portable and using Ethereum's
on-chain storage is inherently not portable when comparred to e.g. a web
application's backend or a user storing their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials</a> in their offline &quot;data
backpack.&quot; On the other hand, one could argue that VCs aren't well-portable
either as we can't use JSON directly in smart contracts today.</li>
<li>(7. Interoperability): Identities must be as widely usable as possible. But
e.g. using storage space on Ethereum means that it's only interoperable with
other EVM-based chains, whereas e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials</a> simply require JSON or
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token">JWT</a> support.</li>
<li>(9. Minimization): A claim's disclosure must be minimized: E.g. storing a
subjective claim about another private person on-chain makes it public to the
entire globe.</li>
<li>and finally, (10. Protection): The rights of users must be protected and
public blockchains aren't capable of protecting e.g. an EU citizen's &quot;Right
To Be Forgotten&quot; or GDPR as on-chain data may not be removable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hence, since ABTs shouldn't be used as credentials on-chain: what should
they be used for?</p>
<h3>Account-bound Tokens are Special Ownership Deeds</h3>
<p>Originally, one of us submitted
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> as a solution for
implementing Harberger property when it became apparent that &quot;<a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2022/02/19/non-skeuomorphic-harberger-properties-erc721-nfts/">Non-Skeuomorphic
Harberger Properties may not be implementable as ERC721
NFTs</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The problems that lead to this approach are that
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a> and other token standards
implicitly assume the ownership structures adhering to normative private
property laws. Even before Weyl et al's &quot;Decentralized Society&quot; paper, we had
blogged about it and so the work on
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> goes back to specific
Solidity implementations of Harberger property contracts
[<a href="https://github.com/rugpullindex/libharberger">1</a>
<a href="https://github.com/721labs/partial-common-ownership">2</a>] in Ethereum and the
<a href="https://partialcommonownership.com/">Partial Common Ownership working group</a>.</p>
<p>Direct motivating factors for publishing
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> was that it would allow
users to display an NFT-ish <strong>token</strong> in their wallet while giving wallet
implementers the possibility to call
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165">EIP-165</a>'s <code>supportsInterface</code> method
for feature detection. In that sense, Account-bound tokens were meant as a
simple backward-compatibility hack &quot;free-riding&quot; on any wallet implementing
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">EIP-721</a>.</p>
<p>So, strictly speaking, although we acknowledge the
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> standard to coincidentially
be useful for issuing credentials, it must be noted that our focus is on
creating new type of ownership experience.</p>
<h3>An Exception: Putting Credentials On-chain</h3>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that there are cases where it can make sense to put
credentials or claims on-chain. In a post titled &quot;<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html">Where to use a blockchain in
non-financial
applications?</a>&quot;, Vitalik
Buterin makes the case why storing some credentials on-chain seems useful.</p>
<p>Finally, a word on how we see Soulbound tokens being standardized.</p>
<h2>Misconception #5: EIP-4973 ABTs is the best standard, and no others should exist</h2>
<p>Already within the working groups for
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a>, we've branched off and
listened to the community's feedback that is interested in, e.g., binding
tokens to ENS names. As a result, we've &quot;forked&quot;
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973">EIP-4973</a> to a new standard called
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5107">&quot;name-bound&quot; tokens</a> and submitted
it as a draft PR to the ethereum/EIP repository.</p>
<p>Additionally, by intentionally binding tokens to accounts, we've furthered the
discussion around whether that's a good idea. As a response, more generalized
approaches like Micah Zoltu's
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5114">EIP-5114</a> are now being submitted
too. It allows to bind ERC721s to ERC721s and hence doesn't have the supposed
key rotation issue.</p>
<p>We hope <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5107">EIP-5107</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5114">EIP-5114</a> and
<a href="https://erc1238.notion.site/">EIP-1238</a> aren't the last attempts at defining
Soulbound tokens for Ethereum. Rather, we think that for collective
intelligence to emerge, although it often feels personal, many new ways of
expressing property on-chain will be discovered to understand what users truly
want.</p>
<p>We must encourage other standards. Let's learn from each other to create a
decentralized society and find web3's soul.</p>
