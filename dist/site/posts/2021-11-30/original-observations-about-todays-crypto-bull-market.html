    <h1>Observations About Today's Crypto Bull Market</h1>
<p>They say that a market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
And while by no means, I consider myself a crypto bull - the solvency of
against-the-market bettors surely is uncertain right now.</p>
<p>Rationality has rage quit the game, and so here we are. But actually, I wanna
keep this short and focused. I just want to journal the observations of these
days' market sentiment for posterity.</p>
<p>The following are original observations of the cryptosphere in the today's
&quot;late-stage&quot; bull market. They're original, as they significantly differ from
the observations I made in, e.g., the last late-stage bull market in crypto in 2018. By no means is this list exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bull market has lasted so long that certain bullshit qualities and
behavior now managed to persist into the sphere's &quot;culture&quot; without market
participants being aware. Whole projects are founded on hot air but faithful
in their belief that the hype train will eventually come to pick them up.</li>
<li>External spectators, e.g., commentators of Hacker News, have stopped being
capable of differentiating between the space's former quality projects and
today's bullshit. They (rightfully?) equate all of crypto to a big scam or
ponzi, and their tone has turned particularly aggressive and unforgiving.</li>
<li>Genuine present-day innovation is being undervalued compared to speculative
future results. I have colleagues complain that all their community wants is
tokens when, in fact, they're shipping game-changing innovation.</li>
<li>Some of the space's newcomers that I meet are so deluded and confused that
any non-hype-based narrative slips past them. Will there be a lost generation
of crypto devs?</li>
<li>Generally, any non-hype-based and crypto-mainstream-leaning idea gets left
unnoticed while repeating the 0815-formula gets particular wide-ranging
praise. Does your project even exist without launching an ERC20 token?</li>
<li>A degree of thought-synchronization has taken place that discriminates
originality and evangelizes <em>the one way of doing things.</em></li>
<li>Numerous long-standing contributors that I have known to be true believers
over many years have started turning sour and cynical. Some have become
openly and/or cloaked opponents/critics.</li>
<li>For everyone, including experts in the field, it continues to become more
challenging to separate noise from signal.</li>
<li>It has become ludicrously easy to raise money with no strings attached to
build any type of software. It's great, but it doesn't feel real.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's all. I hope you can appreciate this different type of blogging too.</p>
