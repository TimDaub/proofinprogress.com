## 2021

- **"awesome-ethereum-rollups"**
  [[repository]](https://github.com/rugpullindex/awesome-ethereum-rollups): In
  2021, layer 2s are finally getting shipped and so at Rug Pull Index, we want
  to understand which are the best ones. We're also considering building our
  own. As part of some multi-month research, I publish and update
  awesome-ethereum-rollups which is a list of resources on rollups.

- **"eth-fun"** [[source]](https://github.com/attestate/eth-fun): We see a need

  cumbersome to use MS Excel or Google Spreadsheets to make sense of my crypto
  currency taxes. I need more precise tooling. So I build taxtool, which is a

  where a malicious party pulls a significant portion of liquidity from a
  market to take profits. As attacks for on-chain crypto currency exchanges
  accumulate, I launch an index that rates markets by their risk of getting rug
  pulled. I get sponsored by the Ocean Protocol Foundation to develop the
  project further.

  doing small gigs for clients from all over the world.
